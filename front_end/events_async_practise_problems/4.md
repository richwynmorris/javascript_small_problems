The code below is buggy. The person who created the code expects that nothing will happen when the user 
clicks on the image. 
This, however, isn't the case; clicking the image still brings the user to another web page.

```js
document.querySelector('img').addEventListener('click', event => {
  event.stopPropagation();
}, false);
```


### Answer:
The reasontthe image still brings the user to another web page is because the `stopPropagation` call
on line 2, prevents the event from bubbling back through the DOM tree on its return and firing on any listeners, however, the event still takes place when the call meets the target element. To prevent the webpage from opening, you should add the `Event.preventDefault()` call to prevent the default action from taking place.
